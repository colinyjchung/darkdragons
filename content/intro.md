## What is a Role-Playing Game? (RPG)

A role-playing game (**RPG**) is where a bunch of people sit around a table and tell a story together, but with rules and dice.

One person acts as a **“dungeon master”** (DM) or _referee_. This person describes the setting, side characters and events. 

Everyone else are **player characters** (PCs). They react to the situations thrown at them by saying what they want to do and roll dice to find out if they succeed.

Put simply —

1. The DM describes a scene. 
2. Players decide what to do.
3. They roll dice to see if it works.
4. DM describes the consequences.
5. _Rinse and repeat._

## What kind of stories are told?

There are _a lot_ of RPG settings out there. 

* There's fantasy (like _Game of Thrones_). 
* There's space opera (like _Star Wars_). 
* There's investigative horror (like _X-Files_). 
* There's cyberpunk (like _Blade Runner_).
* There's one where you play incompetent criminals like a Coen Brothers flick. 
* There's even one based on Mexican soap operas!

**_Buuuut_**... the first (_and most popular_) RPG of all time is **Dungeons & Dragons** (D&D).

In D&D, the players are **“adventurers”** seeking treasure in a fantasy setting (castles, dragons, and magic spells).

## What is an **adventurer**?

While "modern" D&D is about heroes saving the universe from evil villains... 

_I like to run my games the "old school" way._

Old School D&D is where adventurers are misfits, outcasts and scoundrels who can’t get a “regular” job in the feudal system and have resorted to...

* Robbing graves with deadly traps
* Treasure hunting in abandoned ruins
* Stealing from dragons and powerful wizards
* Chasing rumors of secret caches of wealth 
* Hunting monsters for money

In other words, this is high-risk work done by desperate people for high-rewards.

**It also makes for sillier game where players can die in dumb ways.**

But players can also play smart and survive!

## Here are some tips:

* Combat is dangerous. You can die. Think of ways to talk, trick or get past monsters without fighting.
* If you have to fight, fight dirty. Be sneaky. Use the element of surprise. Especially if you’re outnumbered or they’re bigger than you.
* It’s ok to ask and hire help in town. Henchmen are great. (Send them ahead or make them do chores).
* Magic is powerful but also unpredictable and dangerous.
* And remember — the point is to get your hands on treasure, not kill monsters. (This isn't a video game!)

And if (and when) your character dies, don't pout. Roll up a new one. It only takes five minutes.

# Why Play RPGs?

Aside from getting together with a group of friends to make up silly stories together... could you argue RPGs are also _educational_? 

My answer is yes. Let's break it down. When you're role-playing, what are you doing exactly?

1. Project Management
2. Making Decisions as a Group
3. Strategic Planning
4. Creative Thinking

Wait. _Really, Colin?_ Aren't you just justifying a silly game where you kill goblins and loot bodies?

Let's break down each of those:

##### Project Management

A D&D adventure is basically a camping trip where you happen to also kill monsters and steal their treasure. Each player can only carry so many items, so they have to plan on _what_ to bring, _how much_, and _who_ should carry what items. Sometimes, players can hire henchpeople, adding an element of HR. In other words, the planning stage of an adventure is basically logistics and resource allocation.

##### Making Decisions as a Group

D&D adventures are played with friends. And together, you make decisions on _where_ to go, _whether_ to fight or retreat, and whether split-up or stay together inside a dungeon. I'd say 40-60% of the time as a DM, I'm just sitting there listening to the players argue about what to do next.

This inevitably creates a group dynamic where diplomacy, leadership and team cohesion has to take place. Yes, there's shouting and arguing... but the players have to -- in one way or another -- decide on what to do... _together_ as a group.

##### Strategic Planning

This should be self-evident by now. As I throw problems, resources, and decision-trees at the players, they as a group must weigh the pros and cons of each decision. Sometimes, one player will remember an old fact or NPC which leads the team to a breakthrough in solving a problem they're facing. Smarter players take notes.

##### Creative Thinking

The most beautiful thing about a live, in-person table top RPG... something video games can never, truly replace... is the fact that you _literally can do anything_. In a video game, your decision tree might be: talk, fight, and run. In a tabletop RPG, you might use an item you have in a way that only the human imagination can conjure up. 

Many players throughout history have MacGuyvered themselves out of a tight spot with random items in their rucksack. Others have used magic spells in ways that the designers didn't intend. Point is -- tabletop RPGs are restricted by the human imagination and when we get creative, our imagination is boundless.

**To me -- a role playing game like D&D actually teaches more relevant work skills than any other hobby.** All of the above skills are required in an office setting when you work with a team.
