## What is a Role-Playing Game? (RPG)

A role-playing game (**RPG**) is where a bunch of people sit around a table and tell a story together, but with rules and dice.

One person acts as a **“dungeon master”** (DM) or _referee_. This person describes the setting, side characters and events. 

Everyone else are **player characters** (PCs). They react to the situations thrown at them by saying what they want to do and roll dice to find out if they succeed.

Put simply —
1. The DM describes a scene. 
2. Players decide what to do.
3. They roll dice to see if it works.
4. DM describes the consequences.
5. _Rinse and repeat._

## What kind of stories are told?

There are _a lot_ of RPG settings out there. 

* There's fantasy (like _Game of Thrones_). 
* There's space opera (like _Star Wars_). 
* There's investigative horror (like _X-Files_). 
* There's cyberpunk (like _Blade Runner_).
* There's one where you play incompetent criminals like a Coen Brothers flick. 
* There's even one based on Mexican soap operas!

**_Buuuut_**... the first (_and most popular_) RPG of all time is **Dungeons & Dragons** (D&D).

In D&D, the players are **“adventurers”** seeking treasure in a fantasy setting (castles, dragons, and magic spells).

## What is an **adventurer**?

While "modern" D&D is about heroes saving the universe from evil villains... 

_I like to run my games the "old school" way._

Old School D&D is where adventurers are misfits, outcasts and scoundrels who can’t get a “regular” job in the feudal system and have resorted to...

* Robbing graves with deadly traps
* Treasure hunting in abandoned ruins
* Stealing from dragons and powerful wizards
* Chasing rumors of secret caches of wealth 
* Hunting monsters for money

In other words, this is high-risk work done by desperate people for high-rewards.

**It also makes for sillier game where players can die in dumb ways.**

But players can also play smart and survive!

## Here are some tips:

* Combat is dangerous. You can die. Think of ways to talk, trick or get past monsters without fighting.
* If you have to fight, fight dirty. Be sneaky. Use the element of surprise. Especially if you’re outnumbered or they’re bigger than you.
* It’s ok to ask and hire help in town. Henchmen are great. (Send them ahead or make them do chores).
* Magic is powerful but also unpredictable and dangerous.
* And remember — the point is to get your hands on treasure, not kill monsters. (This isn't a video game!)

And if (and when) your character dies, don't pout. Roll up a new one. It only takes five minutes.
