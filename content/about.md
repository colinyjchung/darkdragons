## Ruleset & Design Philosophy

My games are ran with a chimeric set of rules. 

At its core, Ben Milton's [Knave](https://questingbeast.itch.io/knave) forms the engine (min(3d6) for ability modifiers, CON+10 item slots). The magic system was pilfered from **Dungeon Crawl Classics** [(DCC)](https://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/). Zero spell slots, spell burn, and cast as often as you like with risk of misfire, but tiered successes. As for everything else, a smattering of Gavin Norman's **Old-School Essentials** [(OSE)](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/old-school-essentials), OSR blogs/zines, [The Angry GM](https://theangrygm.com/) and a heavy dose of improv.

This is my second iteration as a DM. Between 2017-2019, as a first-time DM, I ran twenty-one sessions of D&D 5e for three different parties: Legendary Heroes of Fun & Awesomeness, Blood Hawks, and Brow & Co. I was quickly overburdened with rules bloat. Prepping modules felt like a chore. And 5e's lengthy stat blocks overwhelmed me. Today, the stat blocks in my notes are: 

**Goblin: AC**: 13, **HD**:1(hp:4), **ATK**:1(1d6) **ML**:8

Everything else is made up based on context. In short, I hate accounting and I am an OSR convert. The simpler the rules, the more likely players stop looking at their character sheets and use their imagination. Dice rolls are kept to a minimum and rolled in the open, which also means there is no "game balance". Players must learn to assess risk and reward. Rash and unwise decisions (such as rushing into combat without tactics) should be punished, as in real life.

I keep a record of dead characters in the [graveyard](https://dragonsinthedark.com/graveyard/). My players reading this should visit to pay their respects.

## About Colin

I am a co-founder of [Plural Inc.](https://pluralcopy.com/), a marketing and consulting agency in the DR/DTC space. We are also a [publisher](https://pluralpress.com/) of online courses. Our first project is [Osmosis](https://www.osmosis.dev/), a weekly newsletter that shares the most useful insights from books on entrepreneurship, growth, and marketing.

Aside from running OSR games for my kids and their friends, I also play heavy board games, paint the occasional miniature, and pretend to know about game design on the Internet.
