## Herein Lies the Fallen

Here, laid to rest, the careless many, the rash, the unwise... those who met their maker upon a foolish... and most likely an entirely avoidable decision.

<br/>Crushed by dolmen stone. Gambling debts of 500gp.

* **Surina Juno, Charlton** (L1-EC). _2021-05-23(1d)_
<br/>Head bashed in by drune staff. Sold false jewels.

* **Thork, Zealot of Loki** (L1-HA). _2021-05-23(1d)_
<br/>Charmed then beaten by drune. Husband of Aranna.

* **Thorn, Hedge Wizard** (L1-HA). _2021-05-23(1d)_

_May ye all rest in peace._
