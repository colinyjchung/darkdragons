## Herein Lies the Fallen

Here, laid to rest, the careless many, the rash, the unwise... those who met their maker upon a foolish... and most likely? A wholly, entirely, _avoidable_ decision.

<hr/>

* **Ser Ragnarok, Knight** (L1-OR). _2021-05-23 (1d)_ 
<br/>Crushed by dolmen stone. Gambling debts of 500gp.

* **Surina Juno, Charltan** (L1-EC). _2021-05-23 (1d)_
<br/>Head bashed in by drune staff. Sold false jewels.

* **Thork, Zealot of Loki** (L1-HA). _2021-05-23 (1d)_
<br/>Charmed then beaten by drune. Husband of Aranna.

* **Thorn, Hedge Wizard** (L1-HA). _2021-05-23 (1d)_
<br/>Torn apart by stone hounds. Escaped convict.

* **Darrak, Soldier** (L2-AB). _2021-06-06 (7d)_
<br/>Killed by Gravak, gang boss on magic steroids.

_May ye all rest in peace._

<hr/>

## The Pauper's Grave

Here, laid to rest, hench-people and hirelings who lost their lives following adventurers to places they don't belong.

<hr/>

* **Adele, Archer** (Mgr-HA). _2021-06-13 (1d)_ 
<br/>Suffocated by the ghost of a chaos knight.

_May ye all rest in peace._
